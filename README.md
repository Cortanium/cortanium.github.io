## v1

Heya! I love programming, so I decided to make another version of my personal website. 

This is v1 of the new one. 
If you want to see my old one, go [here](github.com/cortanium/legacywebsite)!

Anyways, here's a changelog and a future updates tab.

- Initial website commit

- Random "Folow me :)" pops up all over your screen, sized to work with mobile too.

- Social integrations all set up


## v2 (Planned)

- Secret easter eggs! 

- Randomization on the "Follow Me :)" text to be more Doge-like.

- Twitch Live integration

- Semi-Gravity web space
